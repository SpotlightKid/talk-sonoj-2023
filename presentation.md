## Why 1978?

* First Analog Poly Synths
* Analog and electro-mechanical instruments still widely used
* On the cusp of the digital revolution
* Great Music! ðŸ˜Ž

---

## Why keyboards?

* Most electronic instruments have keyboards.
* Most virtual instruments are meant to be played via keyboard (because MIDI).
* Great variety of instrument types and technologies used

---

## Short history timeline of keyboards in Pop & Rock

---

Only instruments are listed, which either mark a very important technical development or found significant use in popular music.

---

The year listed marks general availability. Development might have started earlier.

## FLOSS instruments

The state of FLOSS virtual instruments today:

* Lots of new plugins every week
* Many synthesizers
* Good software support for [SFZ](https://sfzformat.com/) since a few years
* Growing pool of SFZ sample libraries
* Lack of presets, instruments and samples tuned for live playing
* Many sample libraries have non-free licenses ðŸ˜ž
